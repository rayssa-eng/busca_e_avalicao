In the newborn infant\\nthe diagnosis of homozygote (PiZZ) deficiency of alpha1-antitrypsin\\ncould be established in cord serum at the time of delivery.  Trypsin\\ninhibitory capacity (TIC) and alpha1-antitrypsin (AT) in cord serum\\nwere in the range of adult homozygotes.  By means of crossed\\nimmunoelectrophoresis exclusively, the phenotypic alleles ZZ were\\ndemonstrable.  This excludes the possibility of materno-fetal\\ntransfer of alpha1-antitrypsin.  In infant amniotic fluid extremely\\nlow antiprotease-activity and substantially no alpha1-antitrypsin was\\nfound, whereas in normal samples the TIC is 3% to 6% of the cord\\nserum values and the AT 1.2% to 4% of cord serum concentration.  Our\\ndata suggest that a major component of TIC and AT in normal amniotic\\nfluid derive from the fetus.  In normal meconium we detected TIC and\\nAT in concentrations increasing proportionally to the total protein\\ncontent.  The inhibitory capacity of AT in meconium expressed in mg\\ntrypsin inhibited per mg alpha1-antitrypsin however is 80% less than\\nserum alpha1-antitrypsin.  No correlation exists with the free\\ntryptic activity of meconium.  The AT of an PiZZ infant is clearly\\ndiminished when referred to fresh weight, whereas meconia from three\\ncystic fibrosis newborns screened by the BM test had extremely high\\nconcentrations.  Estimation of TIC and AT in meconium is regarded as\\na useful approach for screening on homozygote alpha1-antitrypsin\\ndeficiency.  The exact diagnosis however can only be established by\\nphenotyping the alleles.  In cystic fibrosis the high protein content\\nof meconium is accompanied by increased alpha1-antitrypsin levels.',\n",
