       "'Neonatal peritonitis remains a dangerous condition.  Factors\\ncomplicating diagnosis and management include its low incidence, the\\ndiversity of aetiological factors found, and the severity of\\nunderlying or associated disease.  28 cases presenting since 1957 at\\nSouthmead General Hospital were reviewed.  Thirteen aetiological\\nfactors relating to mother or baby were found.  13 infants were\\npremature, 10 had severe respiratory problems at birth.  Maternal\\nhydramnios was present in 7.  6 babies had had exchange transfusion.\\nThe commonest findings were gangrenous volvulus and cystic fibrosis.\\nCombined factors were often present.  The usual presentation is with\\nbilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to pass normal\\nmeconium.  4 cases had distended abdomens at birth.  Plain abdominal\\nx-rays are of great diagnostic value.  Pneumoperitoneum is diagnostic\\nbut absent from early films.  Treatment is surgical.  Close liaison\\nwith the paediatrician who sees the baby first is essential.  In\\nassessing results it is pointed out that many of these babies are\\nsmall and/or suffering from serious conditions such as haemolytic\\ndisease, cystic fibrosis, or gangrenous volvulus.  8 cases were\\nconsidered unfit for surgery.  Of 20 submitted to surgery, 12\\nsurvived, mostly in the latter part of the series.'"
